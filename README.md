# Eventop - high school final project (2023)
Final Project is a simple web application developed in 2023 as my high school graduation project.
At the time, I was just beginning to explore web design and frontend development. The goal
of this app was to simulate a basic event management interface, embedded as a
webview using a React-based frontend.

While this project doesn’t follow the best coding practices and lacks
many advanced features, it holds great personal value. It represents one
of my first real steps into programming—an experience that was not onl
y fun but also the moment I began to genuinely care about buildingthings with code.
